            <h1>There are different programming languages that involve web development</h1>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Perl</h2>
        <p>
            The Perl family of computer languages has been widely used by thousands of developers since its inception over 30 years ago due to its ease of use and adaptability. Perl is simple to learn and use since it has a common grammar with most other coding languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            With 25,000 open-source modules, this language is procedural, functional, and object-oriented. It connects with external C/C++ libraries and integrates with numerous third-party databases. Perl is slow in general but effective when manipulating text.
        </p>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is most useful for AI, server-side web development (where it is almost synonymous with Django), desktop application design, machine learning, and data analysis and manipulation.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h2>C#</h2>
            C# is a high-level programming language that was developed by Microsoft in 2002 and has its roots in Visual Basic. It is among the most widely used programming languages worldwide as of 2022. Moreover, C# makes it easy to create apps quickly with frameworks like Xamarin. Furthermore, app portability that would not be possible with JavaScript frameworks like NodeJS or AngularJS can be made possible by.NET Framework and.NET Core.
